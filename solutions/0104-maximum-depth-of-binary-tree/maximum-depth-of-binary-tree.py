# Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
#
# The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
#
# Note:Â A leaf is a node with no children.
#
# Example:
#
# Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
#
#
#     3
#    / \
#   9  20
#     /  \
#    15   7
#
# return its depth = 3.
#

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
